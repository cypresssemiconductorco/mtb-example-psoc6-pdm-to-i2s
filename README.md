# PSoC 6 MCU: PDM to I2S Example

This example demonstrates how to route Pulse-Density Modulation (PDM) audio data to the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) interface in PSoC® 6 MCU.

## Overview

This code example shows how to record a short audio sample from a microphone, and then play it on a speaker or headphone. The example uses the PDM/PCM block to interface with a digital microphone. All recorded data is stored in the internal SRAM. Once the recording completes, the I2S block starts sending data to an external audio codec. A record is initiated by pressing the user button on the kit. Once the button is released, it plays back whatever was recorded while the button was pressed.

## Hardware Setup

This code example requires the [TFT Display Shield Board CY8CKIT-028-TFT](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/tft-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-tft), which has the audio codec. This board comes with CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT. It can also be purchased standalone and be used with any other Arduino-compatible PSoC 6 MCU kit.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party module - [Pmod I2S2: Stereo Audio Input and Output](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-i2s2-stereo-audio-input-and-output/) if you are using a prototyping kit, like CY8CPROTO-062-4343W.

If using the Pmod I2S2 module, make the following connections:

| I2S Signal       | Kit Pin    | Pmod IS2S Pin    |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- |
| TX_SCK           | P5[1]      |   J1.2 |
| TX_DATA          | P5[3]      |   J1.4 |
| TX_WS            | P5[2]      |   J1.3 |
| MCLK             | P5[0]      |   J1.1 |
| GND              | GND        |   GND  |
| VCC              | VTARG      |   VCC  |

**Note:** If using CY8CPROTO-062-4343W, you can solder the Pmod I2S2 module to the kit's Pmod header J15.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

This example does not require any software tool.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the Quick Panel.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps.

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

    For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the TFT Display Shield to the main board. If using the Pmod I2S2 module, connect to the prototyping kit.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

3. Connect a speaker or headphone to the audio jack located in the TFT Display Shield Board (CY8CKIT-028-TFT), or to the Pmod I2S2 green audio jack.

4. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Press the user button and hold it. Speak over the microphone to record a short message (up to 2 seconds).

6. Release the user button and listen to the recorded message with the headphone or speaker.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

The [CY8CKIT-028-TFT](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/tft-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-tft) shield contains the audio codec [AK4954A](https://www.akm.com/global/en/products/audio/audio-codec/ak4954aen/), an audio jack, and a digital microphone. This allows you to record data using the microphone and play it with the audio codec. You can connect a speaker or headphone to the audio jack.

The first stage is to record any sound coming from the microphone and place it in the SRAM of PSoC 6 MCU. This whole process can be achieved using PDM/PCM driver to transfer the data from the Rx buffer to an array allocated in the SRAM. Once the sound is recorded, the I2S driver transfers data from the SRAM to the Tx buffer.

To record a longer audio stream from the microphone, a sample rate of only 8 ksps is configured in both hardware blocks - PDM/PCM and I2S. The word length of the PDM/PCM Rx buffer and the I2S Tx buffer are set to 16 bits. The number of elements allocated for the recorded data array is 65,536, consuming a total of 128 KB of SRAM.

PSoC 6 MCU also provides the clock source for the audio codec. Based on the AK4954A datasheet, this codec requires an 2.048 MHz MCLK to sample at 8 kHz. The code example contains an I2C Master, through which PSoC 6 MCU configures the audio codec. The code example includes the AK4954A library (*deps/audio-codec-ak4954a.mtb*) dependency to easily configure the AK4954A. If you do not desire to use the AK4954A, you can edit the Makefile to remove the line *DEFINES+=USE_AK4954A*.

MCLK is generated by using a PWM running at the desired frequency. The clock that is used to source the PWM and the audio subsystem must be the same to avoid any synchronization issues. This example uses the PLL to source the CPU/peripherals and the audio subsystem.

**Note:** the desired frequency values set in this code example cannot be achieved by sourcing the PLL from the IMO (8 MHz). Therefore, slightly different values are enforced in the firmware to avoid issues during the initialization of the PWM and I2S.
